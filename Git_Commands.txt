## Git Commands

## "git add ." <- adds all new files
## "git add -u" <- updates tracking for files that changed names or were deleted
## "git add -A" <- does both of the above
## before you "commit", you need to "add" them to the index

## Once they have been "added" to the index, then you can "commit" them to the local repo
## "git commit -m "message" <- only updates the local repo, does not update remote repo on Github

## Once they have been "committed" to the local repo, you can "push" them to the remote repo
## "git push" <- take all changes you have committed and put them up on Github

## Branches

## "git checkout -b branchname" <- create a new branch
## "git branch" <- what branch am I on currently
## "git checkout master" <- take me back to master branch
